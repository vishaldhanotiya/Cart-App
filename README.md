# Cart-App

This was my first react-native POC project ðŸ˜€. It was created in 2017 with react-native 0.51. Today when I deleted some of the old projects from the system to freeup some space. So I found my first react-native POC project. When I created this POC project. I was the single developer of react-native in the company but now we have 15+ team members in React Native. Previously I worked on Android Native applications but the first time I started working on cross-platform applications. So I thought to upgrade its react-native version and upload this project on git as a memory of the learning phase of react-native.
