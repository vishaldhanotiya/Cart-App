# Cart-App

This was my first react-native demo project :). It was created in 2017 with react-native 0.51. Today when I delete the demo project from the system to free some space. I  found my first react-native demo project. When I was created this demo project. I was the only single developer of react-native in the company but now we have 15 plus team members in react native. Previously I was worked on Android Native applications but the first time I started working on cross-platform applications. So I thought to upgrade its react-native version and upload this project on git as a memory of the learning phase of react-native memory.
